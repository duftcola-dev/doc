HOW TO SYNC TWO GIT REPOSITORIES
The basis of this is git so it should work on Github and bitbucked

1) Create a repository
	
	** lets assume the current folder is RepoA
	git init 

2) Add remote origin for the current repository

	git remote add origin <url_here> 
	
3) Commit initial changes

	git add --all
	git commit -m "something something"
	
	
4) Specify the new repository that will by synchronized 

	git remote add upstream <url_here> 
	
	example :
		
		RepoA is our current local repository 
		RepoB is the "other" remote repo we want to sync with 
		
		git remote add RepoB <url>
	
5) Check the new repository is exists in your fork 

	git remote -v
	
	**It should output somthing like this 
	RepoB   https://github.com/duftcola-dev/RepoB.git (fetch)
	RepoB   https://github.com/duftcola-dev/RepoB.git (push)
	origin  https://github.com/duftcola-dev/RepoA.git (fetch)
	origin  https://github.com/duftcola-dev/RepoA.git (push)
	
6) Check the branches and commits from the upstream / Sync repositories 
	
	** from RepoA
	git fetch RepoB
	**This will create a detached head .
	**Changes in this state will not affect other branches
	**You can use switch to change to the new branch 
		git switch -c RepoB/master
	
		git switch - ** to go back to master
		
	
	**However we dont want to switch to RepoB/master
	**We want to merge the cahnges of certain files into local master
	   
		git checkout --patch branch_name   folder/file_name.somtehing
		
	Example :
	
		** from local branch master 
		git checkout --patch RepoB/master ./prefect.sh
		
		** This command will ask for you permission in the following way :
		\ No newline at end of file
		(1/1) Apply this hunk to index and worktree [y,n,q,a,d,e,?]? ** reponse with y (yes)
		
	WARNING :
		*File that need to be merged should be in the same location
		*Do not checkout nor create a branch with the detached head name!
		git branch RepoB/master  *** DONT DO THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUNSTANCE !!! It wilRepol fuck everyting***
		**All changes should be sync from branch mastergit 

Second approach git switch --orphan temp
