REDIS:

#HOW TO USE REDIS
    *start the redis server :
        - redis-server
    *enter in the redis shell :
        - redis-cli
    *authenticate:
        - auth <roo-password>

    ** by default redis has a default user or root user that
    only requires a password.
    
    ** new user can be added that will require an username.

#BASIC COMMMANDS :

    *redis follows the scheme : key:key value

    example 
    user:name "robin"
    user:address "london"

    GET <key:key> * returns the value of the speficied key
    SET <key:key> * creates the speficied key and sets a value
    SAVE *executing just this word will save the data permanently in the database and will create 
    a snapshot
    EXIT *to low out of the redis shell
